        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package uncooked rotini pasta</li>
            <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 cup chunky blue cheese dressing</li>
            <li>½ cup buffalo wing sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound frozen cooked chicken strips, defrosted and diced</li>
            <li>½ cup red bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>½ cup green bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1 cup red onion, diced</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the rotini, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
            <li>Stir together the mayonnaise, blue cheese dressing, buffalo wing sauce, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add the chicken, bell peppers, red onion, and cooked pasta and toss to coat with the dressing. Cover and chill at least 1 hour in the refrigerator before serving.</li>
        </ol>
